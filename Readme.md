## Hello Git

- "I'm adding from test-branch"

-> An upstream branch is a remote branch that your local branch tracks.
-> when you set an upstream branch using set upstream you are essentially linking your local branch to a branch on a remote repo through this command you push a local feature branch to the origin remote repository and then you set the upstream branch for your local feature branch to track origin feature branch.

-> Alternatively you also use this command -
- ## git push -u origin branch_name
