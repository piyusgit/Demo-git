## Hello Git

## Branching & Merging ##
-> Branching in git allow you to create different versions of your project
-> For creating new Branch-
## git branch branch_name
-> And go to this branch-
## git checkout branch_name
-> If you do these two-step - creating branch or switching to that in one go then -
## git checkout -b branch_name
-> For creating a new branch with someone existing branch-
## git branch new_branch_name source_branch

- "I'm adding from test-branch"

-> An upstream branch is a remote branch that your local branch tracks.
-> when you set an upstream branch using set upstream you are essentially linking your local branch to a branch on a remote repo through this command you push a local feature branch to the origin remote repository and then you set the upstream branch for your local feature branch to track origin feature branch.

-> Alternatively you also use this command -
- ## git push -u origin branch_name
